Portfolio OS is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that automatically switches your wallpaper when you toggle between light and dark mode. Set it once and forget it — Portfolio OS runs silently in the background and keeps your desktop looking perfect in any appearance.

Why Portfolio OS?
macOS lets you schedule or manually switch between light and dark mode — but your wallpaper never changes with it. Portfolio OS fixes that problem with a simple, frictionless solution. No complicated setup. No bloat. Just open the app, pick your two wallpapers, and Portfolio OS handles everything else automatically — forever.
